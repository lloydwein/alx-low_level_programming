Debugging
Rubber Duck Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

We want to assign j a new value, not compare it, so it should be j = j - 1 instead of j == j - 1


We want to compare j so we need an if statement before j == j - 1


We don’t need to assign a new value to j because it doesn’t do anything

Tips:
You do not have to know exactly what this code does yet (but you will soon!).

Question #2
This code doesn’t work as intended.

#include "main.h"

/**
* main - prints even numbers from 0 to 100
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
                if (i % 2 != 0)
                {
                        continue;
                }
                else
                {
                        break;
                }

                printf("%d\n", i);
        }

        return(0);
}
Let’s add printf statements to the code. What information do the printf statements tell us about how our code is executed?

#include "main.h"

/**
* main - prints even numbers from 0 to 100
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Before loop\n");

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
                if (i % 2 != 0)
                {
                        printf("i is not even so don't print\n");
                        continue;
                }
                else
                {
                        printf("i is even, break to print\n");
                        break;
                }

                printf("Outside of if/else, still inside for loop\n");

                printf("%d\n", i);
        }

        printf("For loop exited\n");

        return(0);
}

A printf statement shows exactly how many times the loop executes


A printf statement shows that there is an infinite loop in the code


printf statements shows that break will cause “For loop exited” to print, indicating that the even number is never printed


A printf statement shows when the for loop is finished

Question #3
The following code gives this incorrect output. Which of the following statements about what is causing the error is true?

j never increments so it is always going to print 0


j never increments so it will always be less than 10

Tasks
0. Multiple mains
mandatory
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.h
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H

#include <stdio.h>

void positive_or_negative(int i);

#endif /* MAIN_H */
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ 
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c main.c
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./a.out
98 is positive
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./0-main
0 is zero

1. Like, comment, subscribe
mandatory
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat 1-main.c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
* main - causes an infinite loop

        int i;

        printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

        i = 0;

        while (i < 10)

        }

        printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

        return (0);

Date: 02/29/2000
Invalid date: 02/29/2000

? That doesn’t seem right.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

Line count will not be checked for this task.
You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
